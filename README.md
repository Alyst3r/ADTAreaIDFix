# ADTAreaIDFix
 
A small tool I've written to fix retroported ADTs that were saved in Noggit Red without proper entries in AreaTable.dbc.
Nothing groundbreaking. Probably could be written better.

How to: put retroported ADTs you want to fix in "out" folder next to exe. Put root ADTs from newer xpak in "root" folder next to exe. Run exe either by clicking or through cmd. Done.
